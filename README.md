# What does it do:
- Nothing serious, by default param spider doesn't have a file feature and you would have to supply your gathered subdomains one by one manually. So this 10 line code would love overyou subdomain list with ParamSpider.

# Get it to work:
- Make sure ParamSpider is installed on your home dir (~/)
- Give pspider-overlist.py execution perms `chmod +x pspider-overlist.py`
- If you have multiple python installations make sure to update the Shebang in pspider.overlist.py to !/usr/bin/python3
- Run it `./pspider-overlist.py <subdomains-file>`
